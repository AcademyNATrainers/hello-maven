# Maven Hello World
This project is used to download Maven dependencies to your local repo.  Just add/modify the existing `pom.xml` file to include your needed libaries and they will be downloaded when you run a `mvn package` or `mvn install` command.

Typical download times for all Spring Boot libraries can be anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes, depending on the connection speed.
